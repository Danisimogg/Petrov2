I was born in Ukraine, my musical adventures began at the age of 4 with a violin.
I took part in many competitions and received the Grand Prix at most of them.
At the age of 11, I've begun to be interested in musical composition, starting with the creation of small pieces for piano and violin, as well as electronic music.
Now I can compose music for a large orchestra, EDM, Rock band and pop music.
I've studied violin at the Benedetto Marcello Conservatory in Venice, because I was interested in creating music for video games, movies,
television and animation, I got my way to study in Japan. I graduated from Tokyo Visual Arts and have got my first well-paid video game music concert.
Right now I am continuing my journey with new projects and discoveries.
